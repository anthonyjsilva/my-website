# Practicing JS Logic With Rock Paper Scissors

### Lets use rps to practice turning real world logic into code and our approach to that process

> Prompt:
Write a JavaScript function called rockPaperScissors that takes two arguments that are strings which represent either rock, paper, or scissors. It should return a string that represents the winning option, or in the case of a tie, returns 'Its a tie!'.
Write Tests to prove it works.

There are 3 levels.

Level 1: Make it return the correct winner or tie for tie and write basic tests to test this.

Level 2: refactor logic and clean up and still pass console.assert tests
Level 3: use latest syntax, refactor some more and maybe write custom tests?
